# 🚀 Prototypes in JavaScript: From Objects to Classes

Learn how JavaScript’s prototype system powers inheritance by building objects step by step, optimizing shared methods, using `Object.create`, understanding `prototype`, and finally converting everything into modern `class` syntax.

## 📚 What You’ll Learn

```
✓ Why JavaScript is a prototype-based language and why prototypes matter
✓ How to create objects using object literals and add properties/methods dynamically
✓ How functions act like objects in JavaScript (and how to inspect them)
✓ How to build reusable object creators using constructor functions
✓ Why duplicating methods across instances wastes memory in large apps
✓ How to share methods using a separate methods object (and the drawbacks)
✓ How Object.create works and how child objects access parent properties
✓ How prototype-based inheritance explains Object.create behavior
✓ How to replace external method objects using a constructor’s prototype
✓ What “prototype” really is: a function property that points to an object
✓ How shared methods live on Person.prototype and are inherited by instances
✓ How the new keyword automates object creation and returns the instance
✓ How this works inside constructor functions when using new
✓ How to add shared methods and per-instance properties correctly
✓ How to convert prototype-based code into ES6 class syntax
✓ How built-in objects like Array use prototypes (e.g., Array.prototype.push)
✓ What the prototype chain is and how method/property lookup works
✓ Why modern JavaScript syntax evolves while prototype foundations remain the same
